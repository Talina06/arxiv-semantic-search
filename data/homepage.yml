  subtitle: "Technical Team Lead"
  description: "I work at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.vanmoof.com/'>VanMoof</a>, a smart e-bike manufacturer based in Amsterdam. My background is diverse (you could say I'm a specialized generalist), but always close to digital technology.<br>I have done a bit of everything, from backend development to mobile apps, devops or team leading and coaching. I love automation as a way to optimize processes, and working in happy agile teams - where work is a way to solve problems, and not a mean by itself."

  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    First - online you will find me as <strong>zetxek</strong>, as that is my online nickname. 
    Professionally, I am an <em>"all-round" coder</em> that feels comfortable both in technical and management positions, 
    working side by side with his team. 
    I like being close to the technical details of the solutions while keeping an overview 
    of the business cases that we try to solve with technology. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">I get bored easily if the problem is too narrow - I need to understand the big picture, <em>what</em> frictions we try to mitigate and <em>why</em> it is 
    important - before we jump directly to add technology to the equation.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My main area of focus lies in <strong>web and mobile projects</strong> - anything connected can start to spark my interest.
    I like to have the time to care about the details of the implementation, user journey and UX, while 
    having the chance to get a higher level view and observe how the different parts involved connect to each other
    (via APIs, databases or any other interface), to solve whatever problem we try for our users.
